# RN Coin Hunt — Telegram Mini App

## Project

Telegram Mini App "RN Coin Hunt" — earn coins by completing tasks (check-in, math quiz, watch ads), withdraw via Telegram bot. Source code lives in `rn-coin-hunt/`. The pnpm workspace `artifacts/` directory is unrelated to this project.

## Architecture

- **Single Express server** (`rn-coin-hunt/server.js`) serves:
  - `/` — landing page
  - `/user-app/` — Telegram Mini App (HTML + Firebase JS SDK)
  - `/admin-panel/` — browser admin panel (HTML + Firebase JS SDK)
  - `/uploads/` — QR code images uploaded by users via Telegram
  - `/config.js` — injects Firebase + bot env vars into the user app
- **Telegram bot** runs **in-process** (`rn-coin-hunt/bot/bot.js` is `require()`d after the HTTP server starts listening). Uses long-polling, so no extra port. Single Render service handles everything.
- **Backend**: Firebase Firestore (client SDK in browser, `firebase-admin` in bot).
- **Deploy**: single Node.js Web Service on Render at `https://miniapp-ytyf.onrender.com`.

## Required environment variables (set in Render)

| Name | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `BOT_TOKEN` | Telegram bot token |
| `ADMIN_IDS` (or `ADMIN_TELEGRAM_IDS`) | Comma-separated Telegram user IDs of admins |
| `MINI_APP_URL` | Public URL to `/user-app/` |
| `SERVER_URL` | Public root URL (used to build QR upload URLs) |
| `BOT_USERNAME` | Bot username (without @), for referral links |
| `FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT` | Full service account JSON (one line) for `firebase-admin` |
| `FIREBASE_API_KEY`, `FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN`, `FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID`, `FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET`, `FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID`, `FIREBASE_APP_ID` | For client SDK (served by `/config.js`) |

In Replit dev environment these aren't set, so the bot disables itself but the HTTP server still runs.

## Firestore collections

- `users/{uid}` — `name`, `email`, `balance`, `telegramId`, `isBlocked`, etc.
- `withdrawals/{id}` — `userId`, `userName`, `userEmail`, `telegramId`, `amount`, `method`, `accountName`, `qrCodeUrl` (relative `/uploads/...`), `upiId` (app-only), `source` (`bot` / `app`), `status` (`pending` / `approved` / `rejected` / `binned`), `requestedAt`, `binnedAt`, `processedAt`, `reason`
- `coupons/{id}` — `code`, `totalUses`, `coinsPerUser`, `usedCount`, `usedBy[]`, `createdAt`, `createdBy`
- `notifications/{id}` — broadcast (browser admin → all users)
- `user_notifications/{id}` — per-user (`userId`, `type`, `title`, `message`, `createdAt`)
- `config/main` — app settings:
  - Limits/cooldowns: `dailyAdLimit`, `adCooldown`, `dailyMathLimit`, `mathCooldown`
  - Rewards: `checkinReward`, `referralBonus`, `adReward`, `mathReward`
  - Withdrawal: `minWithdrawal`, `coinValueCoins`, `coinValueInr`, `paymentMethods[]`, `withdrawalOptions[]`
  - **Bot buttons**: `channelLink`, `helpLink`, `policyText`
  - Ads: `monetagScript`, `monetagAdFn`, `customHeadCode`

Recommended dev rule (until proper rules are written): `allow read, write: if request.auth != null;`

## Telegram bot features

### User app (`/user-app/`) — earn flows

All four "Earn Coins" tasks gate the reward behind a Monetag video ad
(via `playMonetagAd()`).

`playMonetagAd()` enforces a **minimum watch time** of
`MIN_AD_WATCH_SECONDS` (default **10 s**). If the Monetag promise
resolves earlier than that — i.e. the user tapped Monetag's own
"Continue" button before its timer ran out, which Monetag allows — we
throw an error and refuse the reward with the message
"Please watch the full ad to earn the reward". This is the closest we
can get to disabling Monetag's Continue button, since that button is
rendered by Monetag's SDK and is not in our DOM.

Tasks:

1. **Daily Check-in** → ad plays first, then `+checkinReward` once per day.
2. **Math Quiz** → 2-digit numbers (10–99), only `+` and `-`. Subtraction
   is always `larger − smaller` so the answer can't be negative.
   On a correct answer, ad plays first, then `+mathReward`.
3. **Watch Video Ad** → ad plays, then `+adReward`.
4. **Claim Coupon** → user enters a code, it's validated against the
   `coupons` collection (re-validated again after the ad in case it gets
   exhausted mid-flow), ad plays, then `+coinsPerUser` is added and a
   `user_notifications` doc is written. Mirrors the bot's claim flow.

### Withdrawal (in-app, UPI)

- All `withdrawalOptions` from `config/main` are shown regardless of
  balance. Amounts above the user's balance are styled muted; selecting
  one shows an inline red warning, and submitting shows
  "Insufficient balance" — selection itself is allowed.
- A user with **any** withdrawal in `pending` or `binned` status cannot
  submit a new one. A yellow banner appears above the submit button and
  the button is disabled until the previous request is `approved` or
  `rejected`.

### Ad-blocker / DNS-blocker detection

On app load (after auth), `detectAdBlocker()` runs in the background
when ads are configured. Two signals:

1. A bait `<div class="adsbox ads ad-banner adsbygoogle …">` — most
   browser blockers hide it (`offsetHeight === 0`).
2. After the Monetag SDK is injected, the configured ad function (e.g.
   `show_10945427`) should appear on `window`. If it never does within
   ~4s, the SDK was blocked (typical for DNS-level blockers like
   `dns.adguard.com`).

If detected, a full-screen `#adblock-modal` (z-index 200) covers the
app. The user must disable the blocker and tap **🔄 Retry**, which
re-runs detection. Ad task buttons also call `playMonetagAd()`, which
does its own runtime check and pops the same modal if the function is
missing.

### Telegram bot user menu (`/start`)
Inline grid: Tasks (web app) · Balance · Withdraw · Claim Coupon · Join Channel · Help · My ID · Policy. Each detail screen has a "← Back to Menu" button.

- **Balance** → shows balance/value with Withdraw + History + Back buttons
- **Withdraw** → multi-step: amount → method → QR upload → account name → submit (saved with `source: 'bot'`)
- **History** → paginated 5-per-page list, status icons (⏳ pending / ✅ approved / ❌ rejected/binned), latest at bottom, Previous/Next/Back keyboard
- **Claim Coupon** → user types code; bot validates against `coupons` collection, increments balance
- **Join Channel / Help / Policy** → reads `channelLink` / `helpLink` / `policyText` from `config/main`
- **My ID** → shows Telegram ID + linked account info

Bot has only `/start` in its commands menu — everything else is button-driven.

### Admin panel (`/admin`, only ADMIN_IDS allowed)
Inline-button menu:
- **⏳ Pending Withdrawals** → one-by-one with Accept / Reject / Skip / 🗑️ To Bin + count
- **🗑️ Bin Requests** → one-by-one with Skip / ↩️ Return
- **📢 Broadcast** — admin sends any message (text/photo/video/audio/voice/document) → bot relays via `copyMessage` to every user with a linked `telegramId`
- **👤 Message User** — admin enters target ID, then sends a message; bot copies it to that user
- **🎟️ Create Coupon** — 3-step wizard: total uses → coins per user → code (or "auto")
- **📊 Stats** — counts of users / pending / approved / binned / coupons

State machines per admin in memory (`adminState`, `adminSkipped`, `adminBinSkipped`).

## Browser admin panel (`/admin-panel/`)

Sections: Dashboard · Users · Withdrawals · **Bin Requests** · **Coupons** · Notifications · Settings.

- **Withdrawals** query uses only `where status==pending` (NO `orderBy`) and sorts client-side. Reason: composite `where + orderBy` requires a Firestore index that often isn't created. Same approach for Bin Requests.
- **Withdrawals row actions**: Approve / Reject / 🗑️ Bin
- **Bin Requests**: ↩️ Return moves status back to `pending`
- **QR / UPI cell**: `qrCellHtml()` resolves relative `qrCodeUrl` against `window.location.origin`, falls back to a "📱 UPI: ..." badge for app-source withdrawals (no QR), and shows "Image unavailable" on `onerror`. Each row also gets a 🤖 Bot / 📱 App source badge.
- **Coupons** page: create form (code/uses/coins) + live list + Delete (soft-disable by setting `totalUses: 0`)
- **Settings → App Settings** now includes:
  - Withdrawal block (min, exchange rate, payment methods, withdrawal amounts)
  - **Bot Buttons block**: Channel Link, Help Link, Policy Text — these power the bot's Join Channel / Help / Policy buttons

All UI text is English.

## Workflow

The pre-configured workflow `Start application` runs `node rn-coin-hunt/server.js`. The bot starts in the same process after the server begins listening.

The `artifacts/api-server` and `artifacts/mockup-sandbox` workflows are unrelated leftover scaffolding from the pnpm workspace template — ignore them for this project.
